**The Pattern Playground provides you a friendly environment to play with your HTML snippets with different CSS repositories.**

###Features
* To use the playground, all you need to know is some HTML markup.
* All patterns are safely saved in cloud via [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).
* You can create new patterns, edit and save existing ones, or delete them if not longer needed.
* You can choose from popular CSS frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/css/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/), and built-in private repositories.
